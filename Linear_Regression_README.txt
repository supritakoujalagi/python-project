LINEAR REGRESSION PROJECT ON BOSTON HOUSING DATASET

Project Overview: This project demonstrates the implementation of a
Linear Regression Machine Learning Model to predict housing prices using
the Boston Housing Dataset.

Objective: - Understand and explore the housing dataset - Perform data
preprocessing - Visualize correlations between different features -
Train and test a Linear Regression model - Evaluate the performance of
the model

Technologies Used: - Python - Pandas - NumPy - Matplotlib - Seaborn -
Scikit-learn

Dataset Features: CRIM - Crime rate ZN - Residential land zone INDUS -
Industrial area CHAS - Charles River dummy variable AGE - Age of
property LSTAT - Lower status population MEDV - Median house value
(Target Variable)

Project Workflow: 1. Import Libraries 2. Load Dataset 3. Data
Preprocessing 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 5. Feature Scaling 6.
Train-Test Split 7. Model Building 8. Model Prediction 9. Model
Evaluation

Evaluation Metrics: - Mean Squared Error (MSE) - Root Mean Squared Error
(RMSE) - R-Squared Score

Conclusion: The Linear Regression model was successfully trained and
tested on the Boston Housing Dataset. The evaluation metrics indicate
how well the model predicts housing prices based on the input features.
